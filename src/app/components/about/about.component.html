      <p>
        I'm a <span class="highlight">Full Stack Developer</span> who actually
        <span class="highlight">gives a shit about building things that work</span>. With a
        <span class="highlight">Master's in Computer Applications</span>, I've spent my time building
        <span class="highlight">real applications</span> instead of just tutorial projects.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-20">
        From <span class="highlight">telehealth platforms</span> at SourceFuse to
        <span class="highlight">audio marketplaces</span> on the side, I've worked with
        <span class="highlight">microservices</span>, <span class="highlight">real-time systems</span>,
        and everything in between. I don't just write code — I build
        <span class="highlight">solutions</span> that people actually use.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-20">
        When I'm not shipping code, I'm probably
        <span class="highlight">making beats</span>, learning something new, or trying to figure
        out how to make my life easier through automation.
